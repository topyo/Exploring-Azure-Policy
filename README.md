Azure Policy is a powerful tool used for managing and ensuring compliance across your  Azure environment. Its key features include:

**Enforcement of Standards**: Helps maintain organizational compliance by creating policies that define rules and effects for your resources.

**Compliance Dashboard:** Offers a holistic view of your environment's compliance state, with the ability to dig deeper into individual resources and policies.

**Bulk and Automatic Remediation:** Enables you to remediate non-compliant resources in bulk and ensures new resources are compliant by automatically applying policies upon creation.
